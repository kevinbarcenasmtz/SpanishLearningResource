  <h2 id="why-mexican-spanish">Why Mexican Spanish?</h2>
  <p>
    Mexican Spanish is the most widely spoken variety of Spanish in the world, with over 130 million
    native speakers in Mexico alone. It features distinctive pronunciation patterns, vocabulary, and
    expressions that set it apart from other Spanish varieties.
  </p>

  <h2 id="our-approach">Our Approach</h2>
  <p>
    Our pedagogical approach emphasizes practical, real-world communication. Each lesson is built
    around authentic situations you might encounter when visiting Mexico or speaking with Mexican
    Spanish speakers.

  <h2 id="how-this-started">How This Started</h2>
  <p>
    This project was inspired by a Palestinian Arabic learning resource that demonstrated how
    effective a well-structured, culturally-rich approach to language learning can be.
  </p>

  <h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
  <p>
    We're grateful to the many native speakers, linguists, and educators who contributed their
    expertise to this project.
